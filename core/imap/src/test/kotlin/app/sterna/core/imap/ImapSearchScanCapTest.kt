/**
 * The attachment scan's ceiling, driven on a real socket: when a folder is deeper than the walk is
 * allowed to look, and what that costs the folders next to it.
 *
 * The flag under test is [ImapFolderHits.incomplete]. It is the whole basis of the "at least N"
 * the screen shows: lose it and a scan that stopped a thousand messages into a folder is presented
 * as a total, which is the overclaim #102 took out of this app. So each case below comes with its
 * witness — a folder the walk DID finish, whose answer must not be marked.
 *
 * The cap itself is a private constant and stays that way: the folders here are sized well above
 * (1500 candidates) and well below (200) it, so the tests describe behaviour rather than pinning a
 * number that is free to move.
