/**
 * A folder renumbered under a pending destroy (Codeberg #99).
 *
 * An IMAP UID identifies a message only inside one numbering. When the server renumbers a folder
 * — a migration, a rebuilt index, a restore — it bumps UIDVALIDITY, and the *shifting* kind of
 * renumbering makes a vacated UID mean ANOTHER MESSAGE rather than nothing. A held-back "Empty
 * trash" that comes back hours later (the destroy worker waits for connectivity: the gap is
 * unbounded) would then destroy by numbers that no longer designate what the user confirmed.
 *
 * The property proved here is negative and therefore stated on the wire: when the numbering does
 * not match, NO command naming a UID leaves the client. Reading the exception is not enough —
 * what matters is that nothing was destroyed before it was thrown.
