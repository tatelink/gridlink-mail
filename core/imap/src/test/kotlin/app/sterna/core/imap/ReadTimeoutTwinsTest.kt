/**
 * ⚠ SOURCE LINT. The two `withReadTimeout` wrappers — one plain, one suspending — cannot call each
 * other (a plain function cannot take a suspending lambda; making the plain one suspend would drag
 * `connect` with it), so they are written twice and must not drift.
 *
 * What drift costs, precisely: every IMAP call the app makes on the pooled connection now goes
 * through the SUSPENDING copy (`ImapMailService.runWithRetry`), while the three tests that pin the
 * budget arithmetic (`AllUidsTest`, `ImapBudgetTest`) exercise the plain one. A copy that quietly
 * stopped setting the socket timeout would leave all of them green and put `ENUMERATE_BUDGET_MS`
 * out of service — the bound that stops an "Empty trash" enumeration waiting out a mute server.
 *
 * Two rules, and the first is the one that matters: the part that can go missing lives in ONE
 * function that both call, so deleting it is a behaviour change the budget tests already see. This
 * file adds the second: the wrappers themselves must stay identical, line for line.
