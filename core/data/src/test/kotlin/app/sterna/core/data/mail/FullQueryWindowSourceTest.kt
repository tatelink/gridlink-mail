/**
 * Dropping an account's cursors opens the full-query branch — and TWO of the four paths that can
 * walk into it carry a hardcoded 50 that has nothing to do with the user's setting: the push/worker
 * pass (`MailRepository.refreshAccountFolders`, `limit = 50`, reached from `FetchAndNotify.run`)
 * and the unified inbox (`MailRepository.refreshAllInboxes`, `limit = 50`, reached from
 * `InboxViewModel.refreshUnified`). Only `refreshFolder` reads `store.syncWindow(...)`.
 *
 * That branch ends in `EmailDao.replaceMailbox`, which DELETES what it is not given, and then
 * re-arms the cursor. So whoever gets there FIRST decides how much of the folder survives, and the
 * deltas that resume afterwards never fetch backwards.
 *
 * The decision under test is the shipped one, [fullQueryWindowTarget], executed. [Folder] below is
 * a stand-in for the two COLLABORATORS — the server walk and `replaceMailbox` — and decides
 * nothing: it takes the target it is handed, keeps exactly what came back, and re-arms. Written
 * that way on purpose: a fake that re-derived the target would pass whatever the shipped rule said.
