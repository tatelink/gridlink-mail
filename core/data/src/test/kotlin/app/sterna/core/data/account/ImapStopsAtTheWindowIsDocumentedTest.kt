/**
 * ⛔ `SyncWindow`'s KDoc once promised that the window "only bounds what stays cached offline"
 * because "the scroll mediator pages older mail in on demand". The bench says otherwise: same
 * device, same gesture, counted in the database per account and per folder, the JMAP Archive went
 * from 1 000 rows to 1 150 by scrolling alone while the IMAP Archive stayed flat at 1 000.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY it does not hold on IMAP is not established, and this file does not pretend it is. The
 * mediator's IMAP branch exists and does fetch older pages (`MailRepository.folderMediator` →
 * `ImapMailService.fetchOlderPage` → `upsertAll`), and it is attached without testing the protocol
 * (`MailRepository.pagedFolder`), so "the app never asks" would be false. The behaviour was NOT
 * fixed either (the repair runs through the reconcile that deletes) — the label was brought down
 * to what is measured, so the only thing left to defend is the label.
 *
 * ⚠ The gate here is NOT a vocabulary heuristic. A keyword rule cannot tell a sentence from its
 * negation: "on IMAP it is a hard ceiling on what is KEPT and never on what reading can reach"
 * names IMAP, names a ceiling, promises exactly the thing that was measured false, and would pass
 * any such rule (it did — that mutation survived the first version of this file). So the shipped
 * KDoc must CARRY [REQUIRED], the sentences declared below, verbatim once normalized. Rewording
 * the KDoc is then a deliberate edit of this test, which is the point: the sentences are the
 * contract, and a reviewer who improves the prose has to look at the bench result while doing it.
 *
 * The keyword blacklist is kept as a second net only ([scrollArrivalClaims]), for a false promise
 * ADDED next to the required ones rather than replacing them.
