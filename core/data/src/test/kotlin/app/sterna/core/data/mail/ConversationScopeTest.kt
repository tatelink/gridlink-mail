/**
 * The chip and the unfold ask ONE question about the same conversation.
 *
 * [ConversationInvariantsSqlTest] (C6) already pins that the chip equals the unfold when both are
 * handed the same folders. What decides those folders is [ConversationScope], and it is where the
 * two used to part company: the chip's Sent folder came from a reactive read of the folder cache,
 * the unfold's from a second, one-shot read whose failure was swallowed into "no Sent folder". A
 * thread with a reply in Sent then wore a chip of 3 and unfolded to 2.
 *
 * So these cases exercise the DECISION, not the queries: each one resolves the folders exactly as
 * the two call sites do — `conversationQuery` through [ConversationScope.sentFolders],
 * `InboxViewModel.expansionMailboxIds` through [ConversationScope.folders] — and then runs the two
 * SHIPPED statements over what it got. The equality is asserted on the outcome the reader sees,
 * the chip's number against the messages the row unfolds into.
 *
 * The witness in each case is a DEGRADED resolution: when the Sent folder does not resolve, both
 * sides must shrink together. Without it these cases would pass on a fixture where the Sent reply
 * is never in play at all — which is precisely the state the bug produced on one side only.
