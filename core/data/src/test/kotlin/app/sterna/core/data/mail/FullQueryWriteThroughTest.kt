 * happens once, at the end, only on a walk that finished.
 *
 * The decision under test is the shipped one, [fullQueryWriteThrough]. The reconcile it is handed
 * runs the shipped complement rule too ([reconcileEvictions]) over a fake folder, so "reconcile
 * against the last page instead of the whole walk" is a mutation these fixtures can SEE: every
 * folder below caches at least one row that only a MIDDLE page names.
 *
 * ⛔ What no test here can check, and what the wiring lint next door
 * ([FullQueryStreamingWiringTest]) is for: that `MailRepository.syncMailbox` still routes through
 * this function, with these arguments.
