/**
 * ⭐ Signing an account out while it syncs must stop what writes in its name — EXECUTED, decision
 * and consequence.
 *
 * The defect: `AccountsViewModel.signOut` tears down push, removes the account, purges its cache
 * and sweeps the orphaned rows — but nothing cancels the sync walk, which lives in the list
 * screen's scope. It carried on writing pages under the removed id long after the sweep had run
 * (a deep folder walks for minutes), re-creating exactly the ghosts of Codeberg #121: cached mail
 * under an account that no longer exists, drawn in the unified list with no chip.
 *
 * What is executed here is the shipped decision ([checkAccountStillConfigured]) inside the shipped
 * order ([fullQueryWriteThrough]). ⛔ What no JVM test can reach is `MailRepository`, which needs
 * Room, a `Context` and a live session — that its walks really call this, with THEIR OWN account
 * id, is pinned as source by [SignedOutAccountWiringTest].
 *
 * ⚠ Every walk below counts the pages it OFFERED, not the pages that were written. That is the
 * whole point of the fixture: "the walk was abandoned" and "the walk ran to the end and wrote
 * nothing" leave the same cache behind, and only the offered count tells them apart. A fix that
 * merely skipped the writes would leave `offered` at five in every test here.
 *
 * ⛔ But the walk below is this test's OWN [Walk] class, so what it proves is that the refusal, when
 * it propagates, stops a walk — not that the SHIPPED walks let it propagate. That second half is one
 * line in each of two other modules (`JmapClient`, `ImapClient`), it is reachable from no JVM test,
 * and wrapping it in a `runCatching` leaves this whole file green. It is pinned, whole-line, by
 * [SyncWalkHandOffWiringTest].
