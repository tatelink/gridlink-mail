/**
 * The agreement between the two ends of a notification pass: what the read REMEMBERS has to cover
 * everything the notifier's age floor can still let through.
 *
 * Both ends are executed, neither is restated: the reads are the shipped `EmailDao.receivedSince`
 * and `EmailDao.idsReceivedSince` run against SQLite, the floor is the shipped [notifyFloor] /
 * [announceableAt] that `NewMailNotifier.newSince` applies. Rows are built by the shipped
 * [toEntity], so their `sortKey` comes from `receivedAt` the way the app derives it — the whole
 * agreement rests on those two being one instant, and setting them by hand would assume exactly
 * what can break.
 *
 * ⚠ The bench is deliberately LARGER than [NOTIFY_CANDIDATE_MAX]. An earlier version of this file
 * worked on eleven rows: it could not observe anything the cap does, which is precisely how a cap
 * that truncated the baseline passed review here. The invariant below is stated on the BASELINE —
 * the capped candidate read is allowed to shed rows, the baseline is not.
