/**
 * The invariant behind the confirmation dialog: **what is named is what is sent.**
 *
 * The defect it closes. A `mailto:` unsubscribe sends the subject and the body the SENDER of the
 * received message wrote into the header — verbatim, to whatever address that header names, under
 * the account's own identity, with a copy in Sent. Keeping them is deliberate (lists that key the
 * unsubscribe off the subject line would otherwise get a mail that does nothing), but the
 * confirmation only ever said "Sterna will send an unsubscribe email to <address>". A header
 * reading `<mailto:hr@example.org?subject=I resign&body=Effective today.>` therefore sent a
 * resignation in two taps, and nothing on screen said so.
 *
 * So both halves are EXECUTED here, on the same fixtures: [unsubscribePreview], which the dialog
 * shows, and [unsubscribeMail], which the outbox row is built from. They are asserted equal
 * field by field, so the day one of them starts computing its own subject the two stop agreeing
 * and this test says which.
