/**
 * ⚠ THIS TEST READS SOURCE TEXT — the last resort, exactly as [ChunkedIdReadsSourceTest] says:
 * `MailRepository` needs Room and a `Context`, so no JVM test can run the wiring below. The
 * DECISION it guards is executed by [DestroyableIdsTest]; this pins only WHERE that decision is
 * plugged in, and it pins the WHOLE LINE of each load-bearing call — `contains` is blind to any
 * mutation that lengthens a line, which is how three of these rules were defeated before.
 *
 * What it exists for (Codeberg #122): the destroy carries ids frozen at the confirmation, and a
 * JMAP id does NOT change when the message changes folder. Another client rescuing a message out
 * of the Trash during the (unbounded) hold-back was therefore destroyed IN ITS NEW FOLDER —
 * nowhere left to recover it from. Every wave must ask the server where its ids are and destroy
 * only those still exactly where the user confirmed them.
