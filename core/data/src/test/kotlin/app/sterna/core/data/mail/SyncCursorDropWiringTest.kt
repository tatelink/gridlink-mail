/**
 * ⚠ SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST. `MailRepository` needs Room, an Android `Context` and a live
 * JMAP session, so it cannot be built in a JVM test; the drop itself is EXECUTED by
 * [SyncWindowDropsCursorsTest] and only the plug is read here — whole lines, never a fragment,
 * because a `contains` on a fragment is blind to any mutation that LENGTHENS the line.
 *
 * Two facts are pinned: that the per-account drop is per account (not the global reset beside it),
 * and that the branch it aims at is the one it is described as aiming at — no cursor means the full
 * query, which is the only place the sync window reaches the network.
