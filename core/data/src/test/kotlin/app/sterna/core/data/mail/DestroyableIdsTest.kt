/**
 * The decision behind Codeberg #122, RUN rather than restated: given what the server says about a
 * wave's ids, which of them may still be destroyed.
 *
 * Measured on the bench, twice, on both entry points (Empty trash and a selection + Delete
 * forever): two messages in the Trash, the destroy held back, another client moves one of them
 * back to the Inbox 2.5 s later, and at t+7.5 s the destroy takes it out IN THE INBOX. The
 * message existed nowhere any more. The first test below is that run, in the terms this function
 * decides in.
