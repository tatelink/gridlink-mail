/**
 * The stateful half of the ghost sweep's gate (Codeberg #107): the bookkeeping that decides when a
 * mailbox may be existence-checked again, exercised over sequences of syncs rather than one
 * decision at a time. The pure gate is pinned in SyncEvictionsTest; what is pinned HERE is what a
 * long-lived process does with it — the reporter's app holds a push foreground service, so "it
 * heals on the next launch" was never an answer.
 *
 * A fake clock stands in for the wall clock so a five-minute floor can be crossed without waiting.
