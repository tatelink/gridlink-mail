/**
 * ⚠ SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — `MailRepository` needs Room, an Android `Context` and a
 * live session, so nothing in this module can build it. What every line pinned here DOES is
 * executed elsewhere ([SyncWindowScaleTest] for the two roles of the number, `SyncPagingTest`
 * for the sizing, `ImapFullQueryWriteThroughTest` for the IMAP walk).
 *
 * The fact this file exists for: the sync window is ONE number, read BEFORE the protocol switch.
 * Changing what a `SyncWindow` means therefore changes both protocols at once, without a line of
 * JMAP or IMAP code moving — and a future edit that gave either branch a number of its own would
 * make one settings row mean two different things without any test noticing.
 *
 * Whole lines, never a fragment: `contains` is blind to every mutation that LENGTHENS a line, and
 * the plausible wrong versions here all do (`limit.coerceAtMost(1000)`, a constant swapped in).
