 * Paging's fetcher runs on the JVM here. What it executes is the DECISION the fix owns — the row
 * a refresh reloads around — driven through the shipped [pagingConfig], plus a replay of the two
 * library rules the decision has to fit into, quoted from the sources of the exact versions this
 * app builds against:
 *
 *   - `androidx.room.paging.util.getOffset` (room 2.6.1): a Refresh whose key is smaller than the
 *     row count is loaded as `LIMIT loadSize OFFSET key` — the key is an offset in the FOLDER.
 *   - `androidx.paging.PageFetcherSnapshotState` (paging 3.3.5): `anchorPosition` is built up from
 *     `placeholdersBefore`, which its getter forces to 0 while placeholders are disabled — so the
 *     anchor handed to `getRefreshKey` is an index in the LOADED WINDOW.
 *
 * The scenario below is those two rules run three times in a row. Whether the reader is thrown
 * back to the newest mail is then a property of the key alone, which is what the fix changes.
