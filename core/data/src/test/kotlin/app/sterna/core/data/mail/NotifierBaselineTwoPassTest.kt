/**
 * TWO PASSES, because one pass cannot see this failure.
 *
 * `NewMailNotifier.seed` REPLACES a folder's baseline (`putStringSet`), it does not union it. So a
 * folder's baseline covers exactly what the pass that wrote it was handed, and anything left out is
 * forgotten — for good, every pass. Whatever bounds the baseline therefore has to be a bound a row
 * can only ever fall OUT of, never back into.
 *
 * A row count is not such a bound. It slides down as rows above it leave the folder (a delete, an
 * archive, a move, a ghost sweep), and the rows it slides onto were dropped from the baseline by
 * the pass before. They are then "not in known", they are inside the age floor, and they announce
 * as new mail — mail that has been sitting in the cache all along.
 *
 * ⚠ And this is not only a wrong notification: the same `newSince` drives
 * `unarchiveThreadsOnReply` (`FetchAndNotify.kt`), an `Email/set` MOVE on the server. A false
 * positive drags mail back out of the Archive the owner had filed. Irreversible-first.
 *
 * So the baseline is seeded from an id-only read bounded by the TIME floor alone, and the row cap
 * belongs to the hydrated candidates the diff walks. Both statements are executed here, out of the
 * shipped DAO, over a bench that is deliberately LARGER than the cap — a bench that never reaches
 * the cap cannot see anything the cap does.
