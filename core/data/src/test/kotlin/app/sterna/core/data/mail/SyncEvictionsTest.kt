/**
 * The eviction decisions of a sync (see SyncEvictions.kt): which cached ids a delta drops, which
 * the ghost sweep drops, and which the retention window drops. The first two encode the ghost
 * invariant — an externally-destroyed message must leave the cache within one sync cycle —
 * without reopening the recently-mutated spare's protections (a live row is never pruned off a
 * stale snapshot; only an authoritative per-id notFound overrides the spare).
 *
 * [retentionEvictions] is the odd one out and the reason it is worth stating: it drops rows the
 * server STILL HAS, on the user's "Messages to sync" setting alone. That makes it the only
 * eviction that can destroy live mail, so its cases here are written from the other side — what
 * it must NOT touch (Codeberg #110) — with a negative witness so "spares more" can't pass for
 * "works".
