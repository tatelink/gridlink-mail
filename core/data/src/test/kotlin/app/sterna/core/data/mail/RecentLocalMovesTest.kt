/**
 * The self-move registry backing the notifier's diff filter (Codeberg #50 follow-up):
 * a message the user moved into a watched folder from this app must not announce as
 * "new mail" on the folder's next notifier pass, for as long as the TTL window that
 * covers the worst-case gap to that pass.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by account + id: the registry is process-wide and JMAP ids are per
 * account, so a bare id let one account's archive silence another account's real mail (#92).
