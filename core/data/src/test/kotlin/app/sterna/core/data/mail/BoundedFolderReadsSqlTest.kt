/**
 * The four folder reads that used to materialise a whole mailbox, and the one thing that makes
 * their fix real: **the bound is in the statement**.
 *
 * Every query here is read out of the shipped DAO by [DaoQuerySource] and EXECUTED against
 * in-memory SQLite, so "the newest twenty" cannot be satisfied by a Kotlin `take(20)` over a
 * folder-wide `SELECT *` — the bench holds more rows than any bound, and a statement without its
 * `LIMIT` hands them all back here. That is the whole difference this file exists to see: the old
 * code returned exactly the same LIST as the new one, and only differed in what it read.
 *
 * The call sites are pinned at the bottom, whole line at a time: a bound that lives in a statement
 * nobody calls is no bound.
