/**
 * The per-sender "future mail to Trash" gesture, EXECUTED: the rule it writes, the composition
 * that adds it to what the account already has, and the order in which the two server calls
 * happen.
 *
 * [addBlockRule] takes its load and its save as parameters precisely so this can run them: the
 * failure that matters (saving a script built on a read that did not succeed) is a failure of
 * ORDER, and no assertion about a rule object can see it.
