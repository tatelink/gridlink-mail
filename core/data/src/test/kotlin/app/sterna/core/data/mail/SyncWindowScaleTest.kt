/**
 * The count scale the "Messages to sync" row offers — 100 / 1 000 / 10 000 — and what each of those
 * numbers actually does. (This file was `UnboundedAllWindowTest`, written when "Everything" meant
 * the whole folder; that choice is withdrawn and the largest window is now 10 000.)
 *
 * `SyncWindow.limit` is read in TWO places that must not be confused:
 *
 * 1. **the size of the window to fetch** — [folderSyncSizing]'s `windowTarget`, which the JMAP walk
 *    counts down with [nextWindowPageLimit] and the IMAP walk turns into a floor sequence number;
 * 2. **the retention floor** — "keep at least the newest N whatever their age" (Codeberg #110),
 *    [retentionEvictions]'s `keepNewest`, which is the window and NEVER a request size.
 *
 * ⚠ Stated exactly: the FETCH WINDOW is exercised below for every new value; the RETENTION FLOOR is
 * exercised on the function, but NO new value reaches it in service. `pruneRetention` only runs
 * under `pruneBeforeMillis != null` and every count window has `maxAgeDays = null`, so the prune is
 * skipped entirely for 100 / 1 000 / 10 000 and for `ALL` (the guards are pinned by
 * `SyncWindowReachesBothProtocolsTest`). What the floor tests below protect is the day a count
 * window gains an age, or the day someone caps the floor with a request size (#110).
 *
 * Every expectation below is a number written out here and compared against the SHIPPED constant, so
 * a member whose value stopped matching its label fails: an assertion like
 * `COUNT_1000.limit == COUNT_1000.limit` would agree with the code whatever the code said. The walks
 * are driven by the shipped decision — this file counts pages, it does not decide how big they are.
 *
 * ⚠ What is NOT covered here: the wire, and the arithmetic of a target near [Int.MAX_VALUE] (no
 * shipped window carries one any more — `core:jmap`'s `JmapClientTest` and `core:imap`'s
 * `FolderWalkDecisionTest` keep that guard, where the arithmetic lives).
