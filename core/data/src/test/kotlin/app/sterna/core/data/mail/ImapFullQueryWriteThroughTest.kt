/**
 * ⭐ The red line on the IMAP side, EXECUTED: pages written as they land, ONE reconcile at the end,
 * and NO reconcile at all when the walk cannot vouch for what it read.
 *
 * The decisions under test are both shipped ones — [fullQueryWriteThrough], which orders the four
 * steps, and [reconcilableIds], which is IMAP's own refusal. The reconcile they are handed runs the
 * shipped complement rule ([reconcileEvictions]) over a fake folder, so "reconcile against the last
 * page" is a mutation these fixtures can SEE: every folder below caches a row only a MIDDLE page
 * names.
 *
 * ⛔ What no JVM test can reach — `MailRepository` needs Room, an Android `Context` and a live IMAP
 * connection — is that `imapWriteThrough` still routes through these two with these arguments. That
 * is the wiring lint next door ([ImapWindowWiringTest]).
