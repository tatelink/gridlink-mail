/**
 * The rules stop filtering when the responder is switched on, and STAY stopped when it is
 * switched off (measured against Stalwart, 2026-08-03 and 04: a single active Sieve script per
 * account, and the return from holiday leaves none active at all). Neither screen said a word.
 *
 * This exercises the decision itself — [filterScriptWarning] is called, not read — because the
 * two places it is wired into (a composable and an Application-bound view model) cannot be
 * instantiated in a JVM test. Two cases are witnesses rather than requirements: the one with no
 * `vacation` script keeps the prediction conditional, and the one with the responder already on
 * keeps it in the future tense. Drop either condition and only its witness moves.
