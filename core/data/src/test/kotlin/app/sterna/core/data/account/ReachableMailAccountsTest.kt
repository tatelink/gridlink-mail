/**
 * [retainReachableMailAccounts] (Codeberg #129): the pure keep/discard decision applied to the mail
 * accounts a JMAP session advertises, EXECUTED here with the probe outcomes the repository hands it.
 *
 * The bug it guards is device-reproduced: a read-only calendar share makes the server list the
 * sharer's account in the session with the mail capability, then answer `forbidden` to every
 * Mailbox/get for it. Sterna minted a sub-account for it and turned its name — the sharer's address
 * — into a `delegated` identity in the composer's From picker.
 *
 * Every expectation below is a literal list, never a re-derivation of the rule: recomputing the
 * decision here would keep the suite green with the shipped condition inverted.
