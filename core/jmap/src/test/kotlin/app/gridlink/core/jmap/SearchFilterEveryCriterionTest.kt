/**
 * Every criterion the search panel offers, one by one and then crossed, on the JMAP side.
 *
 * [SearchFilterTest] pins the SHAPE of the filter (the nested OR, the AND wrapper, the flagged
 * keyword). What it does not pin is that each of the seven boxes carries its own weight: a
 * criterion whose condition is never emitted is invisible in a shape test, and a criterion emitted
 * unconditionally is invisible in a "full query" test — the user ticks a box, the filter looks
 * plausible, and the server answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * Hence two halves, and neither works without the other:
 *  - one criterion set, ALONE, must produce exactly its own condition;
 *  - the same criterion left at its default must produce NOTHING (the witness).
