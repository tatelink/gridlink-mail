/**
 * POSES the state of a bench device over adb: adds one account, puts manual identities on it,
 * restores a block of settings, and READS BACK what it wrote.
 *
 * Why this exists: on 2026-08-06 both bench phones lost their accounts and every screen was retyped
 * by hand — about 34 verified gestures per device (16 of them the IMAP form alone), times three
 * devices. A bench whose repair costs a hundred gestures does not get repaired.
 *
 * ⛔ THE BOUNDARY, NON-NEGOTIABLE: this pipe poses state, it NEVER performs the gesture under
 * measurement. The day an account is added by broadcast in order to validate the add-account
 * screen, the bench proves nothing. Provision the state a scenario STARTS from; drive the screen
 * being tested through the UI like a user.
 *
 * ⛔ EXPOSURE, WRITTEN PLAINLY: this receiver is `android:exported="true"` and carries NO
 * permission. It cannot be otherwise — a non-exported receiver refuses an explicit broadcast from
 * the shell uid, which is exactly how it is driven. So ANY app installed on the device can call it
 * and make it add an account or overwrite settings. Nothing here protects it; what makes that
 * acceptable is that the class only exists in `app.sterna.test`, built behind `-PtestApp`, never
 * shipped: the production package contains no such component. Do not claim a permission guards it,
 * because none does — and do not move this file out of `src/testApp/kotlin`.
 *
 * It declares no intent-filter either, so an implicit broadcast can never land here: the driver
 * must name the component explicitly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW IT IS DRIVEN
 *
 *   adb push bench.json /data/local/tmp/bench.json
 *   adb shell 'touch /data/local/tmp/bench.out && chmod 666 /data/local/tmp/bench.out'
 *   adb shell am broadcast -n app.sterna.test/app.sterna.bench.BenchProvisionReceiver \
 *       -a app.sterna.test.bench.PROVISION \
 *       --es spec /data/local/tmp/bench.json --es out /data/local/tmp/bench.out
 *
 * ⛔ THE SECRET NEVER TRAVELS ON THE BROADCAST. The password is read from the JSON file; the
 * broadcast carries only its PATH. An `--es` password would leak through at least three certain
 * channels: the `argv` of `docker exec` visible in `ps` on the host, the failure output of the
 * driving tool (which reprints the whole command line), and `am`'s own `Broadcasting: Intent { … }`
 * echo. This receiver never prints a password either — not in a report, not in a failure message,
 * not truncated.
 *
 * The out file must be PRE-CREATED world-writable by the pushing script, as above: `/data/local/tmp`
 * is `shell:shell` and this app's uid may traverse it but not create files in it. If the file is
 * missing or unwritable the run still produces its verdict — see "WHERE THE VERDICT GOES".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SPEC FILE (one JSON object; all three blocks are optional, but not all three at once)
 *
 * {
 *   "account": {
 *     "mode": "jmap",                       // "jmap" | "jmap-auto" | "imap"
 *     "server": "https://mail.pinty.fr",    // jmap only; ignored (may be absent) for jmap-auto
 *     "username": "alex@pinty.fr",
 *     "password": "…",                      // the ONLY place a secret ever appears
 *     "accountName": "Alex JMAP",
 *     "imapHost": "mail.pinty.fr",          // imap only, from here down
 *     "imapPort": 993,
 *     "imapSecurity": "TLS",                // TLS | STARTTLS | NONE
 *     "smtpHost": "mail.pinty.fr",
 *     "smtpPort": 587,
 *     "smtpSecurity": "STARTTLS"
 *   },
 *   "identities": [
 *     { "id": "bench-alias", "name": "Alex Alias", "email": "alias@pinty.fr",
 *       "signature": "-- \nAlex", "signatureHtml": "", "default": true }
 *   ],
 *   "settings": { "themeMode": "DARK", "conversationView": true, "unreadTint": true }
 * }
 *
 * `settings` is a `SettingsBackup` object — the very same JSON the app's own settings export
 * writes, so a bench is described by ONE file. A whole exported backup can be pasted in here,
 * minus its `accounts` block (see below).
 *
 * NO `account` BLOCK = pose the identities and the settings on the CURRENT account. That is how an
 * already-provisioned device is topped up: a device that still has its accounts but lost a setting,
 * or a persona that needs one more alias. Adding the same account twice is refused as a duplicate,
 * so this is the only way in on such a device. Identities with no account block and no current
 * account is an explicit failure, and a spec with none of the three blocks is refused outright.
 *
 * ⛔ AN UNKNOWN KEY IS REFUSED — in the spec, in `account`, in an identity entry. `"smptPort": 465`
 * used to fall through to the 587 default and report success: a plausible-looking wrong port on the
 * very form (16 gestures) this whole pipe exists to stop retyping. What is posed is also read back
 * and compared field by field, so a right key with a wrong value fails too.
 *
 * ⛔ `settings.accounts` IS REFUSED, not ignored. That field belongs to the settings-import path,
 * which is a DIFFERENT account creator; this receiver does not borrow it. A spec carrying it fails
 * loudly rather than quietly creating accounts by another route.
 *
 * ⚠ TWO SETTINGS ARE NOT POSED, because `SettingsRepository.restoreBackup` does not apply them:
 * `language` and `pushAllAccounts`. This receiver does not guess them by writing DataStore behind
 * the repository's back — and ASKING FOR EITHER FAILS THE RUN: they land in the report's `manual`
 * list, `manual` is not empty, so `ok` is false and the broadcast returns 1. A bench spec simply
 * does not carry those two keys; one that does is asking for a device state this pipe will not
 * produce, and being told "yes" would be a lie. Set them by hand.
 *
 * ⛔ THE WELCOME SCREEN *IS* SKIPPED — measured on the bench, 2026-08-06, and stated here because
 * this file used to claim the opposite. `hasSeenWelcome` is indeed left alone (it is not part of a
 * settings backup), but leaving it alone preserves nothing: `SternaApp.kt` only consults that flag
 * under `RootState.NeedAccount`, and an account posed here makes the state `Authenticated`, so the
 * welcome branch is never evaluated. A freshly provisioned device lands straight on the message
 * list. Witness: the same `pm clear` WITHOUT provisioning does show the welcome screen.
 * Consequence, and it is the whole point of the boundary above: the welcome screen is one more
 * screen this pipe short-circuits, so it needs a DELIBERATE hand pass in the test plans — it does
 * not get one for free.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO — each of these bought something
 *
 *  - It invents NO add path. It builds a [ConnectViewModel] and calls the same three functions the
 *    connect screen calls, then watches its `state`. It does not copy their probe, their validate /
 *    persist / prime lambdas, their inbox-metadata write, nor the store's own account creator —
 *    that ordering is what closed #121 (priming a cache before the account exists wrote a page of
 *    inbox rows under `accountId = ""`, rows no account owns and no label can name). A fourth copy
 *    of it here would re-open exactly that.
 *  - It NEVER undoes its own add. A failed priming keeps the account, by design in the ViewModel;
 *    taking it back out moves the current account and leaves folder rows behind.
 *  - It REMOVES NOTHING, ever. No account deletion, no purge, no reset. Starting from zero is
 *    `adb shell pm clear app.sterna.test`, which is the shell's job, not this receiver's.
 *  - It REFUSES A DUPLICATE instead of overwriting it. An account with the same (endpoint,
 *    username, protocol) already present is an explicit failure and nothing is written. The bench
 *    has already carried six homonym accounts nobody could tell apart on screen.
 *  - Manual identities are posed with the store's manual identity setter, never the server-owned
 *    one: the server list is rewritten on every connect, so an identity posed there would vanish at
 *    the first sync. Existing manual identities are merged, never replaced wholesale.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHERE THE VERDICT GOES — and why it is a read-back
 *
 * The verdict is computed by RE-READING the store and the settings snapshot after writing, never
 * from "the broadcast was delivered". A recent false green was a `print` of a constant that nothing
 * measured. Every field the spec asked for is compared against what came back: the account's own
 * fields, the identities, the settings. The `readback` action does the same read on its own, with
 * no write at all (what its `ok` means is documented on that function).
 *
 * Three channels, all carrying the same JSON report, none of them ever carrying a password:
 *  1. logcat, tag [TAG], one line per report line (`adb logcat -d -s BenchProvision`);
 *  2. the file named by the `out` extra, when it is writable — a script reads it without parsing
 *     logcat;
 *  3. the ordered-broadcast result: code 0 on success, 1 on failure, with a one-line summary as
 *     result data, which `am broadcast` prints on the shell's stdout by itself.
 * Channel 3 is what a script should branch on; 1 and 2 are what a human reads afterwards.
