/**
 * A chip and its unfold must still agree A MINUTE AFTER the row was opened.
 *
 * [app.gridlink.core.data.mail.ConversationScopeTest] pins that they agree when both are handed the
 * same folders, at one instant. Nothing pinned what happens next, and next is where the reader saw
 * the defect come back: the chip is a live query — Room re-runs it on every write to `emails` — and
 * the unfold was read once, when the row opened. So a message arriving in a conversation left open
 * (a notification, a refresh, a reply of one's own) moved the number and not the messages, and a
 * folder cache that finished syncing after the tap rebuilt the chip around a Sent folder the
 * unfolded list had never been given. Neither corrected itself while the folder stayed open.
 *
 * The fake here is the `emails` table: one mutable list, read through the SAME scope decision the
 * chip is bound with ([ListScope.folders]). It answers all three questions the screen asks of it —
 * the chip's count, the row's representative, and the members — so every case can move the table or
 * the scope UNDER an already-unfolded row and ask whether the three still say one thing.
 *
 * [screen] is what the reader actually sees, assembled the way [InboxScreen] assembles it: the row
 * draws the representative, and beneath it go the members minus that same message. That last
 * subtraction is the reason this file has to model the row at all — done anywhere but at the draw,
 * on anything but the id the row is drawing, it takes the wrong message out.
