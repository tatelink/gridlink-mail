/**
 * The advanced-filter panel can now be dragged from three places instead of one: its handle, the
 * band above it (title bar and free-text field), and its own body once its scroll has run out.
 *
 * Only the decision taken when the finger LIFTS is testable off-device — the layout and the gesture
 * plumbing are not — but it is also the one worth pinning: it is shared by all three grab points,
 * and the failure it guards against is silent. If one of them ever grew its own copy, the same
 * flick would open the panel from the handle and leave it shut from the title bar, and nobody would
 * find that except a user reporting that "sometimes it doesn't open".
 *
 * A height of 400 stands for the panel's measured height throughout; a velocity is px/s, positive
 * downwards (the direction that pulls the panel out).
