/**
 * A whole-tree lint: the machine that serves the maintainer's real mail must not be named
 * anywhere in this public checkout.
 *
 * WHY. The bench runs against a private server. Its name kept leaking into the repo through the
 * two doors that look harmless — a KDoc example the maintainer copies at the bench, and an import
 * fixture pasted from a real export — and nothing stopped it coming back. This test is the stop.
 * The public convention is `example.com` / `mail.example.com` (already used by the neighbouring
 * `outlook-xoauth2.k9s` fixture).
 *
 * HOW IT IS BUILT, and each point cost something:
 *
 *  - ⛔ NO `git ls-files`. In the toolchain container a worktree's `.git` points at an absolute
 *    host path that does not exist there; git answers "not a git repository" and zero files, so a
 *    lint built on it would be green and empty in the very tree being written.
 *  - So the tree is WALKED, from the repo root, with exclusions named one by one below. Never a
 *    list of files to scan: a brand-new file must be seen without anyone editing this test.
 *  - ⛔ The forbidden label is NOT written as one literal anywhere in this file. The walk reads
 *    this file too, and a lint that spells its own target reports itself on every run.
 *  - The decision is a PURE FUNCTION, [namesThePrivateHost], EXECUTED against pinned lines by
 *    [theDecisionIsExecutedOnPinnedLines]. A test that re-derived the rule to choose what to feed
 *    it would be a copy of the rule, green under any mutation of it — so the pinned lines are
 *    spelled from their own fragments, deliberately not from the constant the decision uses.
 *  - The walk PROVES IT WALKED ([theWalkReallyCoveredTheTree]). A lint whose scope quietly shrinks
 *    is green and measures nothing, so the file count has a floor AND named witnesses must have
 *    been read. The witnesses matter more than the floor: amputating one published directory
 *    (`fastlane/`, `site/`) leaves hundreds of files behind and clears any floor.
 *  - The walk-and-report is PARAMETERISED BY ITS ROOT ([offencesUnder]) and executed against a
 *    throwaway tree that really carries the label ([aPlantedFileIsReported_andTheTwoExclusionsAreNot]).
 *    That is the only positive case: this checkout is clean, so without it, emptying the report
 *    body leaves the whole suite green.
