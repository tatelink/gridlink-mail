/**
 * The three-state background of a message row (#141): selected, unread, read — plus the
 * return-from-message flash laid over whichever of the three applies.
 *
 * [rowBackground] is a pure function, so it is *run* here rather than read: every case pins the
 * arguments it was called with and the colour that came back. The schemes are built from sentinel
 * colours (values that cannot be mistaken for one another) instead of real Material tones, so a
 * swapped role comes out as a plain inequality and not as a near-miss between two greys.
 *
 * The opacity cases use the app's real schemes as well: the swipe reveal is drawn *under* the row
 * (InboxScreen), so a translucent row background would let it bleed through for the whole gesture.
