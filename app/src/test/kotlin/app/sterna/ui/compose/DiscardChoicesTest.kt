/**
 * Which buttons the "you are leaving without saving" dialog offers, and which of them may be tapped
 * (#35, #127).
 *
 * The report, with a screenshot: an unencrypted draft, the dialog titled "Discard message?", and
 * two buttons — [Discard] [Save draft]. Neither goes back to what the user was writing. Tapping
 * outside the dialog did, all along; there was simply nothing on screen that said so, and the one
 * button that reads like a way out is the one that throws the editing away.
 *
 * So Cancel is not optional in any layout, and that is what the first test says. The encrypted
 * layout already had it; the other two did not.
 *
 * The second guarantee here is 1.4.3's, and it is a security one: an encrypted message must never
 * be offered a way to become a draft, because a draft is uploaded exactly as typed. It used to be
 * held by the SHAPE of the composable — the save branch sat inside an `if` — where nothing could
 * run it. Here it is a value, and it can be checked against every input there is.
 *
 * The third is what this dialog was still getting wrong after both of those were fixed: it offered
 * an ENABLED "Save draft" over a composer with nothing in it. `ComposeViewModel.saveDraft` reads
 * [draftHasContent], finds nothing, and DELETES the draft it was opened on — so the button that
 * promises to save destroyed the copy on the server, in silence. The toolbar has always greyed its
 * Save icon on that same value; the dialog had no `enabled` at all.
