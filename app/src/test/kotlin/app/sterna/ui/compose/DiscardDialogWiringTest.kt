/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — it reads `ComposeScreen.kt` as text, proves nothing about
 * what appears on screen, and would still pass if the code it points at were broken inside. Same
 * instrument as `SettingsScreenHonestyTest`, and the same reason: `ComposeScreen` is a composable,
 * there is no Robolectric and there are no instrumented tests here.
 *
 * [DiscardWordingTest] and [DiscardChoicesTest] run the two decisions. What neither can see is the
 * one-word edit that turns their answers back into the defect: DRAFT mapped to the old title
 * resource, or the buttons drawn from something other than [discardChoices]. Both leave every
 * behaviour test green.
 *
 * It reads only the `if (showDiscard) { … }` block, so the rest of the file may be reshaped freely.
