/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument and same disclaimer as
 * [app.sterna.ui.NavHostSourceRulesTest]: it reads sources as text. It proves NOTHING about what a
 * keyboard receives. What the interceptor DOES is executed in [IncognitoInterceptorTest], and the
 * bit it adds in [IncognitoImeOptionsTest]; this file only checks WHERE the request is made.
 *
 * Placement is the half that no unit test can reach, and it has two failure modes, opposite and
 * both silent — nothing on screen changes for either:
 *
 *  - TOO LITTLE. A composer that is mounted without the wrapper: a second route tomorrow, or the
 *    wrapper quietly dropped. The promise "the composer's keyboard is asked to forget" breaks.
 *  - TOO MUCH. The wrapper moved up, or a second one added: `MainActivity` wrapping `SternaApp`,
 *    or `IncognitoKeyboard { SearchScreen(…) }`, makes the WHOLE app incognito. Search would lose
 *    the keyboard's memory, which recalling a contact's name depends on; settings and account
 *    setup too. That exceeds what was promised, and it destroys the bench witness — search must
 *    stay NOT incognito, otherwise "placed everywhere" cannot be told from "placed right".
 *
 * So the rule is counted over ALL of `app/src/main`, not over one file and not over one
 * occurrence: `IncognitoKeyboard {` appears exactly once in the application, and that occurrence
 * wraps the composer and nothing else.
