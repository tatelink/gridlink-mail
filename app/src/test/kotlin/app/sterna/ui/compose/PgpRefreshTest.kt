/**
 * What the padlock settles on when the composer re-checks OpenPGP (#35), and — the part that was
 * missing — what it owes the user when it has to give a mode up.
 *
 * The composer re-checks on open, when a restored message puts its own mode back, and on every
 * "From" switch. Dropping a mode is sometimes right (nothing here can encrypt), but doing it in
 * silence is not: the toggle is not even drawn when OpenPGP is unavailable, so a message the user
 * had encrypted came back with no padlock and no explanation, looking like an ordinary mail.
