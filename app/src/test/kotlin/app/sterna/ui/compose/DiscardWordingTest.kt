/**
 * What the "you are leaving without saving" dialog is allowed to claim (#70/#35).
 *
 * The defect it exists to close: a message reopened from the Outbox keeps its row there, so leaving
 * hands it back — while the dialog said "Discard message?" and offered a "Discard" button. The user
 * believed they had destroyed a mail that was still there.
 *
 * There is deliberately no input for where that row lands. `OutboxLogic.stateAfterEdit` sends a
 * spent send back to FAILED and everything else back to QUEUED, so a single wording has to be true
 * of both — which is why it says the message stays in the outbox and stops there, rather than
 * promising it will go out.
