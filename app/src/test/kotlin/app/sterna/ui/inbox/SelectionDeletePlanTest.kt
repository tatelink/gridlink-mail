/**
 * [planSelectionDelete] — who is destroyed and who is moved, executed rather than re-derived.
 *
 * The destroy leg is irreversible after the Undo window, and the probe that used to decide it
 * (`deleteWouldDestroy`) reads the row's OWN folder: on a row that only exists on screen that
 * folder was frozen at crawl time, and on an account with no Trash the probe answers "destroy" for
 * every row it is shown. Hence: only a trusted row can be destroyed; an untrusted one goes to the
 * Trash (search excludes Trash and Junk, so a hit is never in it already); and on a Trash-less
 * account an untrusted row is left alone, to be counted and announced, never destroyed on a guess.
