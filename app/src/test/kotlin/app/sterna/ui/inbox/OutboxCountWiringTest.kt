/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument and the same disclaimer as
 * [ConversationScopeWiringTest]: it reads source files as text, proves nothing about what appears on
 * screen, and would still pass if the code it points at were broken inside.
 *
 * It exists because #70's fix is a WIRING fix, and nothing else in the suite can hold it.
 * `OutboxQueuedCountTest` proves what `OutboxLogic.queuedCount` and `OutboxLogic.activeCount`
 * COMPUTE, and that the two disagree for the length of the grace. It says nothing about which of
 * them each indicator is plugged into — which is the entire change. Point the menu entry back at
 * `outboxCount` and #70 is reverted with the whole suite green; point the toolbar dot at
 * `outboxQueuedCount` and #82 is reopened, likewise green. Neither is reachable from a JVM test:
 * `InboxScreen` is a composable and `InboxViewModel` is an `AndroidViewModel` — no Robolectric, no
 * instrumented tests here — so reading the source is what is left.
 *
 * Verified against the mutations it exists for, one rule failing per mutation: the menu entry's
 * badge rewired back to `outboxCount`, the toolbar badge rewired to `outboxQueuedCount`,
 * `MailRepository.outboxQueuedCount` rewired to `OutboxLogic.badgeCount`, `outboxFlow` losing its
 * filter, and `outboxFlow` gaining a second exclusion beside the shared predicate.
 *
 * What it does NOT do:
 *  - it reads names, so it can only say a call is WRITTEN, never that it works. What the two counts
 *    answer is `OutboxQueuedCountTest`'s job, against real rows and a real SQLite engine;
 *  - it cannot see through an indirection: rename `outboxQueuedCount` to something that forwards to
 *    the graced count and every rule here is satisfied. It pins the shape the plausible mistake
 *    takes — the one-word edit at a call site — not every conceivable one;
 *  - the two shape rules on the repository are deliberately tight (the exact expression, whitespace
 *    apart). A correct refactor that rewrites either expression will redden them. That direction of
 *    error is loud and one line to fix; the other direction is a fix that silently comes undone.
