/**
 * ⚠ SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument and the same disclaimer as
 * [SelectAllWiringTest] and [HeldBackDestroyCarriesItsFolderTest]: it reads `InboxViewModel.kt` as
 * text, proves nothing about what happens on screen, and would still pass if the code it points at
 * were broken inside.
 *
 * It exists because [SelectionTargetsTest] RUNS the decision but is handed its inputs by the test,
 * and `InboxViewModel` is an `AndroidViewModel` no JVM test here can instantiate (no Robolectric,
 * no instrumented tests). The two read/unread paths can go back to `repo.cachedEmailsByIds(keys)`
 * in one line — which is the 2026-08-08 bench report: mark read on a search selection acts on the
 * messages that happen to have a cached row and skips the others without acting, failing or saying
 * anything — and every executable test stays green.
 *
 * So it pins the ARGUMENTS, whole and compared as a LIST, never `in`/`contains`: a substring rule
 * accepts anything appended to what it matched, and one of those rewrites is destructive across
 * accounts (a `displayed` argument rebuilt from the current account hands the action another
 * account's message of the same id — ids collide between accounts of one server).
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it reads names, so it can only say a call is written, never that it works.
