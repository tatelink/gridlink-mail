/**
 * ⚠ SOURCE LINT for the plug, with the value it carries EXECUTED beside it. `InboxViewModel` is an
 * `AndroidViewModel` and this module has neither Robolectric nor instrumented tests, so the one
 * line that turns the setting into a request cannot be run here — only read.
 *
 * Why a lint at all when [SyncWindow] is pinned in `core:data`: ⛔ **a test that pins a constant
 * does not prove anything reads it.** `refreshFolder` is where the account's window becomes the
 * `limit` of a refresh, and a number written in its place — 1 000, 50, `PAGE_SIZE` — would leave
 * every constant test green while "Everything" quietly meant something else again. That is the
 * mutation this file exists for, and it is the shape the old defect had.
 *
 * The body is pinned WHOLE, not by presence of lines: an inserted
 * `val limit = minOf(window.limit, 1000)` reads like prudence and leaves every other line where it
 * was.
