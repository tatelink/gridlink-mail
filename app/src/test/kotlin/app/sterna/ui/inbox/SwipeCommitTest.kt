/**
 * How far — or how FAST — a list row must be dragged before letting go runs its action
 * (Codeberg #125).
 *
 * The report is about effort: the swipe used to commit at 40% of the row width, which is about
 * 165 dp on a phone and roughly a thumb-and-a-half of travel per message. The rule is now an
 * absolute distance, K-9/Thunderbird's 72 dp, capped by the old fraction so the gesture can only
 * ever get shorter than it was — OR a flick, which commits wherever the row has got to, as it does
 * in the reference clients the report names.
 *
 * Both things worth pinning are pinned here rather than on screen: the numbers, and the fact that
 * ONE function answers for both the commit and the visual "armed" reveal. Distances are in px
 * throughout — the caller converts — and [distancePx] stands for 72 dp on a ~2.6 density phone.
