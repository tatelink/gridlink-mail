/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument and the same disclaimer as
 * [OutboxCountWiringTest] and [ConversationScopeWiringTest]: it reads source files as text, proves
 * nothing about what happens on screen, and would still pass if the code it points at were broken
 * inside.
 *
 * It exists because [SelectAllKeysTest] runs the decision but is handed its inputs by the test.
 * `selectAll()` can go back to `repo.cachedIds(currentScopes())` in one line, with #126 reopened
 * and every behaviour test still green, and `InboxViewModel` is an `AndroidViewModel` that no JVM
 * test here can instantiate — no Robolectric, no instrumented tests. Reading the source is what is
 * left, and it pins the ARGUMENTS, because a call to `selectAllKeys(...)` handed `results = null`
 * is still a call and still selects the whole folder.
 *
 * The last rule is the one that earns the file: it reads the SCREEN's predicate, so that changing
 * how the screen decides to draw the result list without changing how the selection decides to take
 * it reddens here instead of silently making the two disagree.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it reads names, so it can only say a call is written, never that it works.
