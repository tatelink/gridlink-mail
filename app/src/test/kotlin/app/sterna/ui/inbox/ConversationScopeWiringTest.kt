/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument as [app.sterna.ui.NavHostSourceRulesTest],
 * and the same disclaimer: it reads source files as text, proves nothing about what happens on
 * screen, and would still pass if the code it points at were broken inside.
 *
 * It exists because the guarantee it guards is a WIRING guarantee, and nothing else can hold it.
 * `ConversationScope` decides which folders a conversation covers, and the whole fix is that the
 * chip and the unfold are handed ONE value — the scope the list on screen was built with — and read
 * it the SAME way, live. `ConversationScopeTest` pins the decision but resolves the folders itself;
 * `ThreadMemberStreamTest` pins the live reading but is handed its scope by the test. Both stay
 * green while either call site quietly stops using the recorded value. `InboxViewModel` is not
 * instantiable in a JVM test — no Robolectric, no instrumented tests here — so reading the source
 * is what is left.
 *
 * Verified against the mutations it exists for, one rule failing per mutation: scoping the unfold
 * with `emptyList()`, re-reading the selection at unfold time, giving the chip's pagers
 * `emptyList()` instead of the resolution their own flow produced, resolving the Sent folder a
 * second time, reading the members once instead of observing them, feeding the stream an empty
 * snooze set instead of the observed table, unwrapping one caller of the mask, HANDING ONE OF THOSE
 * CALLERS AN EMPTY SET, deleting a real call and leaving a trailing comment that names it, dropping
 * the recording of the conversation's order at the tap, and keeping that order in the ViewModel
 * where nothing can exercise it.
 *
 * What it does NOT do, stated plainly because the previous version of this paragraph got it wrong:
 *
 *  - It does not check that the value recorded is the value the pager used, only that it is
 *    recorded where the pager is built and read where the unfold is scoped.
 *  - It reads names, so it can only ever say that a call is WRITTEN, never that it works. The two
 *    mutations that matter most here were only ever caught once the behaviour underneath was given
 *    a real test (`ThreadMemberStreamTest`) or the decision was moved somewhere runnable
 *    (`ThreadOrders`). When a rule here is the ONLY thing holding a guarantee, that is a gap to
 *    close, not a result.
 *  - One rule points at `MailRepository`, a module away, and is pinned by SHAPE alone: emptying
 *    those queries out was reasoned about, not run, because the mutation cannot be applied from
 *    here. The real test belongs in core:data, against a database.
 *  - Its cost used to be described as "a false failure, not a false pass". That was untrue: the
 *    reader dropped comment lines but kept TRAILING comments, so deleting a real call and leaving
 *    `// theCall` anywhere in the same body satisfied both the presence rules and the counts.
 *    Comments are now cut before anything is matched ([codeLines]) — with that direction of error
 *    (cutting too much) being the loud one, which is the trade this file can actually afford.
