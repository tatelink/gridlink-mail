/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument and the same disclaimer as
 * [OutboxCountWiringTest]: it reads `InboxScreen.kt` as text, proves nothing about what appears on
 * screen, and would still pass if [swipeCommitThresholdPx] were broken inside. What the rule
 * COMPUTES is [SwipeCommitTest]'s job, against the functions themselves.
 *
 * It exists because the heart of #125 is a WIRING fix and nothing else in the suite can hold it.
 * The row used to take the same decision TWICE, in two expressions written separately: the commit,
 * in the drag handler, and `armed` — the reveal colour, the label pop, the haptic tick — in
 * composition. They agreed by coincidence and had already drifted on three details (one took
 * `abs()`, the other compared a signed fraction twice; one guarded on `rowWidth > 0`, the other on
 * `coerceAtLeast(1f)`; one checked the actions, the other did not). The screen promises, in its own
 * comment, that the reveal arms "the moment releasing would trigger the action"; that promise is
 * only structural if both sites are the SAME call. Split them again and every behaviour test stays
 * green while the reveal lights at one distance and the action fires at another.
 *
 * `InboxScreen` is a composable — no Robolectric, no instrumented tests here — so reading the
 * source is what is left.
 *
 * The second half of #125 added a flick path, and with it a handful of facts that live ONLY in the
 * wiring and cannot be asserted anywhere else: that the velocity tracker is fed in both event loops
 * (the direction-lock phase's travel is discarded, so a short flick happens almost entirely inside
 * it), that it is reset for every gesture including the abandoned ones, that the published speed is
 * zeroed at the release BEFORE the row springs home, and that a cancelled drag is honoured rather
 * than dropped. What each of those guards then DECIDES is [SwipeCommitTest]'s job; that they are
 * connected at all is this file's.
 *
 * What it does NOT do:
 *  - it reads names and argument text, so it can only say a call is WRITTEN. It cannot see through
 *    an indirection: a `swipeCommitThresholdPx` that forwarded to a fraction would satisfy it;
 *  - the shape rules are deliberately tight (whitespace apart). A correct refactor that rewrites
 *    either site will redden them. That direction of error is loud and one line to fix; the other
 *    direction is a fix that silently comes undone.
