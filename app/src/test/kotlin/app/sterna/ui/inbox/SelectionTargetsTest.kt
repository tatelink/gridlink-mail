/**
 * [resolveSelectionTargets] — what a bulk action acts on, executed rather than re-derived.
 *
 * The defect it answers: every bulk path asked the cache for the selected keys and then iterated
 * the ANSWER, so a selected search hit with no row in the local `emails` table was dropped in
 * silence — no action, no failure, no toast. The walk has to be over the keys, with the drawn row
 * as the fallback.
 *
 * The second half of these tests is about the folder: a row that only exists on screen carries a
 * `mailboxId` frozen at crawl time, and trusting it would make Undo file the message into a stale
 * folder and drop every other folder it was in. So a displayed row is never `folderTrusted`, and
 * that is asserted even when its `mailboxId` looks perfectly good.
