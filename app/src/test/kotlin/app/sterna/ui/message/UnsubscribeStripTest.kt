/**
 * The shape the unsubscribe strip takes, and the one property that matters beyond looks: the
 * three ordinary shapes are the same height.
 *
 * Height is not a taste here. The measured height of the reader's header is part of the key of
 * the `remember` that builds the body's HTML document, so a strip that changes size cancels the
 * body load in flight — and the strip sits in the header, which is exactly where an unsubscribe
 * happens. Before this, every unsubscribe reloaded the message.
 *
 * What a JVM test CAN do is run [unsubscribeStripBody] and hold it against
 * [offeredUnsubscribeAction]; what it cannot do is measure Compose, so the last test is a source
 * lint and says so. It pins the ARGUMENTS — the height floor, the icon's size and tint, which
 * shape draws a button — because a rule that only checks that `TextButton(` appears is satisfied
 * by any strip that happens to contain one.
