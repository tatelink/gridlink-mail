/**
 * The setting that removes the reader's bottom Reply/Forward bar (#63).
 *
 * It is NOT a fix for the bar arriving late: the bar is revealed by a report from the WebView once
 * the body has been measured, deliberately, and that stays. This is for the reader who would rather
 * not have it at all — and nothing becomes unreachable, since Reply, Reply all and Forward all sit
 * in the top bar and its menu.
 *
 * Two decisions, not one, and the second is the one that is easy to forget: the blank the bar sits
 * over is reserved INSIDE the HTML document. Turn the bar off without answering 0 there and every
 * message ends in ~80 dp of white under nothing.
