/**
 * Sender or recipients? [showsRecipients] is that decision, and both surfaces make it here: the
 * list row (`InboxScreen`) and the reader (`MessageViewModel._ownMessage`).
 *
 * #115: a message you send to YOURSELF arrives in the Inbox, and the Inbox showed it as "To: your
 * address" — a line that reads as sent mail in the folder of received mail. The sender test was
 * true wherever the message sat, folder included.
 *
 * The fix is narrow on purpose: the author test is dropped only where the context is EXPLICITLY
 * incoming — the Inbox, and the unified view, which aggregates nothing but Inboxes. Everywhere
 * else it decides exactly as before, and two of those elsewheres are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - #69, a sent message or a draft moved to the Trash still reads "To: …". Nothing but the author
 *    test rescues it there, since the Trash role fails the folder test.
 *  - a folder with no role at all (a custom folder, or a role that has not resolved yet) keeps the
 *    author test, because nothing has established that it holds incoming mail.
