/**
 * SOURCE AND RESOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — same instrument and same disclaimer as
 * [app.sterna.ui.inbox.ConversationScopeWiringTest]: it reads files as text, proves nothing about
 * what is drawn, and would still pass if the screen were broken inside. Compose rendering is not
 * testable in this module (no Robolectric, no instrumented tests), so reading the source is what
 * is left to hold a rule about what the screen says.
 *
 * The rule: IMAP carries no threads at all (`ImapMailService` writes `threadId = null` for every
 * message, and grouping keys on `COALESCE(threadId, id)`, so each IMAP message is its own thread).
 * The Conversations switches used to hide that behind a condition — a note and two greyed switches
 * shown only when EVERY account was IMAP. Adding one JMAP account re-enabled the switches and
 * removed the note, while the IMAP mail sitting on the very same unified list still stood one
 * message per row and nothing said so. The mixed case, the common one, was the silent one.
 *
 * So: the fact belongs in the permanent subtitle, in every language, and the switches must not
 * change state with the account set. Putting `enabled = !imapOnly` back has to fail here.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it does not check that the subtitle is legible, correctly translated, or
 * even displayed — only that the screen no longer couples the switches to the accounts, and that
 * every language's subtitle names both protocols.
 *
 * The wording rule is stricter than it looks and is meant to be: requiring the literals "JMAP" and
 * "IMAP" constrains the SHAPE of every translated sentence, not just its content. A translator who
 * says the same thing without naming the two protocols fails here. That is the trade accepted —
 * the whole statement is which protocol groups and which does not, and there is no way to read a
 * paraphrase for that meaning from a test.
