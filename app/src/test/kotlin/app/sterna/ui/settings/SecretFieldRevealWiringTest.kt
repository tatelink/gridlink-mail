/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — it reads `SettingsComponents.kt` and `SettingsScreen.kt` as
 * text and proves nothing about what is drawn. [RevealIconOfferedTest] runs the decision; this file
 * pins the PLUMBING around it, which nothing in this module can execute: `SettingTextField` is a
 * composable, and there is no Robolectric, no `compose-ui-test` and no `androidTest` here (adding
 * one is a dependency decision, not a test decision).
 *
 * Five silent edits it exists to catch, all of them green under any value test:
 *
 *  1. the decision computed and then ignored — `trailingIcon = if (isPassword)` left in place while
 *     `revealIconOffered` sits unused next to it. That is #118, unchanged;
 *  2. the remember key dropped (`remember { mutableStateOf(false) }`). The reveal state then
 *     outlives the field's content: reveal, clear the field, type again, and the new secret is
 *     drawn in CLEAR TEXT on a settings screen. The key falls on both sides of empty, so clearing
 *     re-arms the mask and so does the first keystroke after that;
 *  3. the mask made conditional, or the icon and its contentDescription desynchronised — an eye
 *     that says "show password" while it is hiding it;
 *  4. ⭐ `isPassword = true` dropped at the ONE call site that types a secret (`SettingsScreen.kt`).
 *     The whole of this file's cleverness is about an eye; the flag that decides whether the field
 *     is masked AT ALL lives elsewhere, and flipping it types the API token in permanent clear;
 *  5. a line ADDED to the field that renders `value` a second time (`supportingText = { Text(value)
 *     }`, a `placeholder`, …): the secret printed under its own masked field, forever. Every other
 *     rule here filters for a line it expects, so an inserted line is invisible to all of them.
 *
 * The guarantee this file holds is narrower than "a freshly typed secret is always masked", and
 * deliberately so: the reveal survives typing (that is the point of an eye), and replacing a whole
 * selection in one `onValueChange` never passes through the empty string, so an open eye stays open.
 * What is guaranteed is: clearing the field re-arms the mask, and the next keystroke is masked.
 *
 * Every rule compares WHOLE LINES (trimmed, nothing else), never `"fragment" in line`: a containment
 * check is blind to every mutation that LENGTHENS the line — `if (revealIconOffered(isPassword,
 * value) || true)` contains the call. `contains` is used only where this file screens for something
 * that must NOT be there.
