/**
 * ⚠ SOURCE LINT for the plug, plus the decision EXECUTED beside it. `AccountsViewModel` is an
 * `AndroidViewModel` and this module has neither Robolectric nor instrumented tests, so the
 * comparison it branches on is run here as a function and only the branch is read as text — whole
 * lines, never a fragment: a `contains` on a fragment is blind to any mutation that LENGTHENS the
 * line, which is precisely the shape `if (changed) mail.dropSyncCursors(id)` has.
 *
 * What the branch is for: the delta branch of a sync never sends the window, so on a folder that
 * already carries a cursor "Messages to sync" did nothing at all until the cursor fell.
