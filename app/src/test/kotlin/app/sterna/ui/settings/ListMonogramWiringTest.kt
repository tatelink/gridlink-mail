/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — it reads five source files as text and proves nothing about
 * what is drawn. Same instrument and disclaimer as [UnreadTintWiringTest] and [PureBlackWiringTest].
 *
 * `SettingsBackupListMonogramTest` runs the decision (the default, the key, the backup field).
 * Nothing here can run the PLUMBING: `MainActivity`, the CompositionLocal, the view model, the
 * Appearance screen and the row itself are all Compose or Android code, and this module has no
 * Robolectric, no `compose-ui-test`, no `androidTest` — adding one is a dependency decision, not a
 * test decision. Five silent edits this file exists to catch:
 *
 *  1. ⭐ **the guard at the row itself inverted, dropped, or leaving the `Spacer` outside it.**
 *     Nothing in this repo executes `EmailListItem`, so `if (!LocalListMonogram.current)` hides the
 *     initials for everyone who asked to keep them, and a `Spacer` left outside the braces adds its
 *     12 dp to the row's own `padding(start = 16.dp)` and leaves a dead band at the start of every
 *     row when the setting is off — the one visual trap of this change;
 *  2. **the default written out as a literal.** It exists in THREE copies — the repository, the
 *     activity's `initial =` and the CompositionLocal's fallback. A `false` in either of the last
 *     two strips the initials off the list for the first frames after launch (or for good, under
 *     any provider-less preview) while every value test still reads `LIST_MONOGRAM_DEFAULT`;
 *  3. the setting collected in the activity and never provided: every row falls back to the
 *     CompositionLocal and the switch does nothing;
 *  4. the switch missing from the Appearance screen, greyed out, hidden behind an `if`, or wired to
 *     the wrong string keys — a row that says "Preview" and toggles the initials;
 *  5. the setting missing from the backup snapshot or the restore: it exports as if it did not
 *     exist, and an import silently puts the initials back for someone who had removed them.
 *
 * Every rule compares a WHOLE line (leading and trailing blanks removed, nothing else), never a
 * `contains` for something it expects to find: a substring check is blind to any mutation that
 * LENGTHENS the line — `initial = LIST_MONOGRAM_DEFAULT && false` contains the constant. `contains`
 * appears only where this file screens for something that must NOT be there.
