/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — it reads four source files as text and proves nothing about
 * what is drawn. Same instrument and disclaimer as [app.sterna.ui.message.ReplyBarWiringTest].
 *
 * `SettingsBackupUnreadTintTest` runs the decision (the default, the key, the backup field), and
 * `RowBackgroundTest` / `ChipFillTest` run the two pure functions the switch feeds. Neither can see
 * the PLUMBING: `MainActivity`, the CompositionLocal, the view model and the Appearance screen are
 * all Compose or Android code, and this module has no Robolectric, no `compose-ui-test`, no
 * `androidTest` — adding one is a dependency decision, not a test decision. Four silent edits:
 *
 *  1. ⭐ **the default written out as a literal.** It exists in THREE copies — the repository, the
 *     activity's `initial =` and the CompositionLocal's fallback. A `false` in either of the last
 *     two paints the whole list flat for the first frames after launch (or for good, under any
 *     provider-less preview) while every value test still reads `UNREAD_TINT_DEFAULT` and passes;
 *  2. the switch missing from the Appearance screen, or greyed out / hidden behind an `if`: the
 *     setting exists and is unreachable, or worse, says it is off while it is on
 *     (`SettingsScreenHonestyTest`'s lesson, paid for once already);
 *  3. the switch wired to the wrong string keys — a row that says "Preview" and toggles the tint;
 *  4. the setting missing from the backup snapshot or the restore: it exports as if it did not
 *     exist, and an import silently turns the tint back on.
 *
 * Every rule compares a WHOLE line (leading and trailing blanks removed, nothing else), never a
 * `contains` for something it expects to find: a substring check is blind to any mutation that
 * LENGTHENS the line — `initial = UNREAD_TINT_DEFAULT && false` contains the constant. `contains`
 * appears only where this file screens for something that must NOT be there.
