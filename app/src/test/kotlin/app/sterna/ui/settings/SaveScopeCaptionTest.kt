/**
 * The account screen shares one form between two ways of writing: four sections (colour,
 * notifications, sync window, PGP) are written the instant they are tapped, while the typed fields
 * wait for Save because they have to be validated first. The button is `enabled = canSave && dirty`
 * (#34), so after an autosaved tap it stays grey — correctly, there is nothing left to write — and
 * on a screen carrying a Save button a grey button reads as a refusal. Nothing on the screen said
 * which fields the button owns. `settings_save_scope` is that sentence.
 *
 * Three rules are held here, and they fail for different reasons.
 *
 * 1. SOURCE LINT (not a behaviour test): the caption is rendered, above the button, in the same
 *    block as the button. Compose is not renderable in this module — no Robolectric, no
 *    instrumented tests — so reading the source is what is left. It proves nothing about pixels.
 *    ⚠ It compares WHOLE LINES, never `"fragment" in line`: a containment check is blind to every
 *    mutation that makes the line longer, which is most of them (adding a `modifier =`, wrapping
 *    the call in a condition, swapping the style for a louder one).
 *
 * 2. THE WORDING DECISION, executed. The caption must NOT say the other settings take effect
 *    immediately, because they do not: `AccountsViewModel.setSyncWindow` writes the value and calls
 *    `refresh()`, which re-reads `currentId` and nothing else — no sync is restarted. Saying
 *    "applies immediately" would replace a mute screen with a false one, on the very row that
 *    produced the report. That decision is [promisesImmediateEffect], a pure function, and it is
 *    RUN twice: once on every shipped caption (must say no) and once on a witness sentence per
 *    language that does promise immediacy (must say yes). Without the witness half, a rule that
 *    answers "no" to everything would be green for the wrong reason.
 *
 * 3. THE POSITIVE ANCHORS. A ban list can only forbid, and seven of the nine captions had nothing
 *    else holding them: an audit reversed the Dutch second sentence into its exact opposite ("are
 *    only saved when you press Save") and the whole file stayed green, because the reversal
 *    contains none of the forbidden words. So each caption must also SAY three things, checked
 *    against the same locale's own resources — its own Save label, its own Identities section
 *    name — plus two sentences and a connective meaning "as soon as you change them". Only the
 *    connective list is written per language here; the other two anchors hold nine translations
 *    without this file containing any of them.
 *
 * What is NOT covered: that any translation means what it says. No test reads a sentence for
 * meaning — a caption can satisfy every anchor and still be clumsy or subtly wrong. The safety net
 * against the enumeration going stale as `save()` grows is the comment on that signature, not this
 * file. And the caption explains only the grey caused by "nothing to write" (`!dirty`), never the
 * grey caused by an invalid form (`!canSave`, `AccountEditorSave.kt:57-70`); that is known and out
 * of scope.
