/**
 * What the "Messages to sync" row OFFERS, and the weld between each offered number and the label it
 * is shown under, in all nine languages.
 *
 * The decision itself is a pure function and is EXECUTED here (`syncWindowChoices()`); the screen is
 * a Composable and this module has neither Robolectric nor instrumented tests, so the two lines that
 * plug it in — the `options =` argument and the label `when` — are read as text, whole lines, never
 * a fragment (a `contains` is blind to every mutation that LENGTHENS a line, and
 * `options = syncWindowChoices() + SyncWindow.ALL` is exactly that shape).
 *
 * ⛔ Why "offered" and "existing" are two different questions. The retired windows (50 / 200 / 500 /
 * "Everything") stay in the enum for ever — their names are the persisted format and deleting one
 * empties every account list that carried it (`SyncWindowStoredNameTest`). So the picker may not
 * show them, and the label `when` must still be able to name them.
