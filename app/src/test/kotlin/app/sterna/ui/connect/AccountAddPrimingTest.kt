/**
 * Adding an account primed its cache BEFORE the account existed (#121).
 *
 * All three add paths built `AccountCredentials` without an id — the field defaults to `""` — and
 * handed them to the repository to "validate and prime the inbox". That priming write is
 * account-scoped: `replaceMailbox(credentials.id, …)`, `replaceAll(credentials.id, …)`. So every
 * account ever added first wrote a full page of inbox rows under `accountId = ""`. No account owns
 * that id, so nothing labels those rows and nothing ever refreshes them: they sat frozen in the
 * state they had at sign-up (unread, flagged), twinned with the real rows they share a mailbox id
 * with. That is the duplicate the reporter saw in "All inboxes" — and what Storage was already
 * calling a "removed account".
 *
 * [addAccountThenPrime] is the order that makes it impossible: prove, create, then prime with
 * credentials it stamps itself. These drive it with recording stubs — no Android, no network.
 *
 * The second rule pinned here is what happens when priming FAILS on an account already created:
 * nothing. The account stays. The first version of this fix took it back out, which moved the
 * current account somewhere else and left the folder rows `refresh()` had already written under an
 * id no account owned — the very orphan #121 closes. [FakeAccountStore] models the store's real
 * removal semantics so that regression stays visible here.
